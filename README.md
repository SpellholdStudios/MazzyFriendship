## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

One of the things many find sorely lacking in the Bioware NPCs are the more complex relationships presented by modern NPC mods--especially in regards to "friendships", the relationships NPCs have with the PC when not romancing them.

This mod adds a series of dialogues for an eligible PC, in which you can discover more about and befriend the valiant halfling. Mazzy is not the most talkative woman in the world, but she definitely has her opinions, and will voice them if she feels it appropriate--similarly if she has questions she will not be afraid to ask.


Visit the <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/mazzy">website</a> or <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/573-mazzy-friendship/">forum</a> for all the latest updates.


<hr>


## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

The Mazzy Friendship mod should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, however, we cannot test every single one. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. If you do encounter an error, please contact <a href="kae@spellholdstudios.net">K'aeloree</a> or alternatively post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/573-mazzy-friendship/">forums</a>.

>Although it is not required for the Mazzy Friendship to function properly, it is always a good idea to install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-mazzy.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: mazzy folder.</em>

<em>When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: mazzy folder and a setup-mazzy.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-mazzy.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-mazzy.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-mazzy --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="faq" id="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is the Mazzy Friendship compatible with XYZ mod?**  
A: It most certainly should be, but we have not tested it with every single mod available. If you do encounter an error, please contact <a href="kae@spellholdstudios.net">K'aeloree</a> or alternatively post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/573-mazzy-friendship/">forums</a>.

**Q: When will the friendship start?**  
A: It should begin around 20 minutes after Mazzy joins your party.

**Q: This mod isn't in character at *all*.**  
A: I'm always looking for ways to improve the characterisation in this mod, so please send any suggestions or criticism to <a href="kae@spellholdstudios.net">me</a> or post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/573-mazzy-friendship/">forums</a>.

**Q: Have you got any plans to expand the mod by adding more dialogues in future?**  
A: Unfortunately I don't have the time to do as much with the mod as I would like, but if you have any suggestions or additions please post on the forum and I'll check them out as soon as I can!

**Q: If I want to start a game in ToB, can I still get the ToB part of the friendship?**  
A: I'm afraid not. You must have played through the Shadows of Amn friendship to get Mazzy's ToB friendship.

**Q: Does this mod change the game in any way besides adding more dialogue to Mazzy?**  
A: No, it shouldn't.

**Q: Is there any chance that player initiated dialogue will be added in future?**  
A: There are currently no plans for it, but if players are interested in it I would be happy to consider adding some in future versions.

**Q: I would like to translate the Mazzy friendship into another language. Any chance you could TRAify the mod?**  
A: Sure, we'd be happy to. If you are interested in translating, just send us a line and I'll see what I can do for the next version.

**Q: God, you're a prick. Please stop modding.**  
A: ... no. :laughing:
